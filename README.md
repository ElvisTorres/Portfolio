[Project 1: Agent's Performance](https://github.com/ElvisTorres/Agents_Performance)
Scenario: There is a customer concerned with the performance of the customer service agents that a company offers. 
The agents' job is to interact with buyers that have questions when purchasing from the customer's website and help finalize the sale. 
The dataset provided contains information about the performance of both companies' agents. 
My job as a data analyst is to go through the data to understand where the customer's performance concerns come from,

Analysis was done using MySQL and visualizations using Tableau.
